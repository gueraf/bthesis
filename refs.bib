	abstract = {In this paper, we present a method for real-time visual simulation of diverse dynamic phenomena using programmable graphics hardware. The simulations we implement use an extension of cellular automata known as the coupled map lattice ({CML}). {CML} represents the state of a dynamic system as continuous values on a discrete lattice. In our implementation we store the lattice values in a texture, and use pixel-level programming to implement simple next-state computations on lattice nodes and their neighbors. We apply these computations successively to produce interactive visual simulations of convection, reaction-diffusion, and boiling. We have built an interactive framework for building and experimenting with {CML} simulations running on graphics hardware, and have integrated them into interactive 3D graphics applications.},

The software performs either well-stirred or spatially resolved stochastic simulations with approximated cytoplasmic crowding in a fast and efficient manner. Our new algorithm efficiently samples the reaction-diffusion master equation using {NVIDIA} {GPUs} and is shown to be two orders of magnitude faster than exact sampling for large systems while maintaining an accuracy of ∼0.1\%. Display of cell models and animation of reaction trajectories involving millions of molecules is facilitated using a plug-in to the popular {VMD} visualization platform.

	abstract = {The paper describes a simple kinetic model of an open monosubstrate enzyme reaction with substrate inhibition and product activation. A comparison between the model and the phosphofructokinase reaction shows a close resemblance between their dynamical properties. This makes it possible to explain qualitatively most experimental data on single-frequency oscillations in glycolysis. A mathematical analysis of the model has shown the following. 
* 1In the model, at a definite relationship between the parameters, self-oscillations arise.
* 2The condition of self-excitation is satisfied more readily with a lower source rate, larger product sink rate constants, lower product-enzyme affinity and higher enzyme activity.
* 3Self-oscillations exist only in a certain range of values of the parameter determining the degree of substrate inhibition. This range increases with decreasing source rate. Too strong or, conversely, too weak substrate inhibition leads to damped oscillations.
* 4The period of self-oscillations depends on the degree of substrate inhibition, the source rate, the sink rate constant, the enzyme activity, the affinity of the substrate and the product for the enzyme; it decreases with an increase in these values.
* 5With an increase in the relative sink rate constant the steady state amplitude of self-oscillations initially increases until a definite maximum is reached and then drops to zero.
* 6A self-oscillatory state in the phosphofructokinase reaction exists only when the maximum rate of this reaction is essentially higher than the source rate, and lower than the maximum rate of the reactions controlling the sink of the products.
* 7An experimental investigation of self-oscillations in the phosphofructokinase reaction may be considerably simplified by using a reconstituted system consisting of a small number of reactions with an irreversible sink of the products and artificial substrate supply. In this case the above relationship (section 6) should hold.},

The procedure developed is novel in that accuracy is guaranteed by performing postleap checks. Because the representation we use separates the randomness of the model from the state of the system, we are able to perform the postleap checks in such a way that the statistics of the sample paths generated will not be biased by the rejections of leaps. Further, since any leap condition is ensured with a probability of one, the simulation method naturally avoids negative population values.},

In conjunction with a comprehensive software platform, the {CUDA} Architecture enables programmers to draw on the immense power of graphics processing units ({GPUs}) when building high-performance applications. {GPUs}, of course, have long been available for demanding graphics and game applications. {CUDA} now brings this valuable resource to programmers working on applications in other domains, including science, engineering, and finance. No knowledge of graphics programming is required–just the ability to program in a modestly extended version of C.         {CUDA} by Example,   written by two senior members of the {CUDA} software platform team, shows programmers how to employ this new technology. The authors introduce each area of {CUDA} development through working examples. After a concise introduction to the {CUDA} platform and architecture, as well as a quick-start guide to {CUDA} C, the book details the techniques and trade-offs associated with each key {CUDA} feature. You’ll discover when to use each {CUDA} C extension and how to write {CUDA} software that delivers truly outstanding performance.

	abstract = {Mathematical reaction-diffusion models have been suggested to describe formation of animal pigmentation patterns and distribution of epidermal appendages. However, the crucial signals and in vivo mechanisms are still elusive. Here we identify {WNT} and its inhibitor {DKK} as primary determinants of murine hair follicle spacing, using a combined experimental and computational modeling approach. Transgenic {DKK} overexpression reduces overall appendage density. Moderate suppression of endogenous {WNT} signaling forces follicles to form clusters during an otherwise normal morphogenetic program. These results confirm predictions of a {WNT}/{DKK}-specific mathematical model and provide in vivo corroboration of the reaction-diffusion mechanism for epidermal appendage formation.},

It provides general implementations of the classical statistical tests for {RNGs}, as well as several others tests proposed in the literature, and some original ones. Predefined tests suites for sequences of uniform random numbers over the interval (0, 1) and for bit sequences are available. Tools are also offered to perform systematic studies of the interaction between a specific test and the structure of the point sets produced by a given family of {RNGs}. That is, for a given kind of test and a given class of {RNGs}, to determine how large should be the sample size of the test, as a function of the generator's period length, before the generator starts to fail the test systematically. Finally, the library provides various types of generators implemented in generic form, as well as many specific generators proposed in the literature or found in widely used software. The tests can be applied to instances of the generators predefined in the library, or to user-defined generators, or to streams of random numbers produced by any kind of device or stored in files. Besides introducing {TestU}01, the article provides a survey and a classification of statistical tests for {RNGs}. It also applies batteries of tests to a long list of widely used {RNGs}.},

Cellular networks and genetic circuits often involve small numbers of key proteins such as transcriptional factors and signaling proteins. In recent years stochastic models have been used successfully for studying noise in biological pathways, and stochastic modelling of biological systems has become a very important research field in computational biology. One of the challenge problems in this field is the reduction of the huge computing time in stochastic simulations. Based on the system of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade that is activated by epidermal growth factor, this work give a parallel implementation by using {OpenMP} and parallelism across the simulation. Special attention is paid to the independence of the generated random numbers in parallel computing, that is a key criterion for the success of stochastic simulations. Numerical results indicate that parallel computers can be used as an efficient tool for simulating the dynamics of large-scale genetic regulatory networks and cellular processes},

At first defined in the theory of nonlinear electronic circuits in a mathematically rigorous way, it can be generalized and proven at least for the class of nonlinear reaction - diffusion systems in physics, chemistry, biology, and brain research. Recently, it was realized by memristors for nanoelectronic device applications. In general, the emergence of complex patterns and structures is explained by symmetry breaking in homogeneous media, which is caused by local activity. This book argues that the principle of local activity is really fundamental in science, and can even be identified in quantum cosmology as symmetry breaking of local gauge symmetries generating the complexity of matter and forces in our universe. Applications are considered in economic, financial, and social systems with the emergence of equilibrium states, symmetry breaking at critical points of phase transitions and risky acting at the edge of chaos.},

It is integrated into {MATLAB} and works with the Systems Biology Toolbox 2 ({SBTOOLBOX}2) for {MATLAB}.
Results: The {GPU}-based parallel implementation of the Gillespie stochastic simulation algorithm ({SSA}), the logarithmic direct method ({LDM}) and the next reaction method ({NRM}) is approximately 85 times faster than the sequential implementation of the {NRM} on a central processing unit ({CPU}). Using our software does not require any changes to the user's models, since it acts as a direct replacement of the stochastic simulation software of the {SBTOOLBOX}2.

	abstract = {An exact method is presented for numerically calculating, within the framework of the stochastic formulation of chemical kinetics, the time evolution of any spatially homogeneous mixture of molecular species which interreact through a specified set of coupled chemical reaction channels. The method is a compact, computer-oriented, Monte Carlo simulation procedure. It should be particularly useful for modeling the transient behavior of well-mixed gas-phase systems in which many molecular species participate in many highly coupled chemical reactions. For “ordinary” chemical systems in which fluctuations and correlations play no significant role, the method stands as an alternative to the traditional procedure of numerically solving the deterministic reaction rate equations. For nonlinear systems near chemical instabilities, where fluctuations and correlations may invalidate the deterministic equations, the method constitutes an efficient way of numerically examining the predictions of the stochastic master equation. Although fully equivalent to the spatially homogeneous master equation, the numerical simulation algorithm presented here is more directly based on a newly defined entity called “the reaction probability density function.” The purpose of this article is to describe the mechanics of the simulation algorithm, and to establish in a rigorous, a priori manner its physical and mathematical validity; numerical applications to specific chemical systems will be presented in subsequent publications.},

	abstract = {{CMOS} power dissipation has been increasing due to the increase in power density. The power dissipation increased fourfold every three years until the early 1990's, due to a constant voltage scaling. Recently, a constant field scaling has been applied to reduce power dissipation, where the power density is increased proportional to the 0.7th power of scaling factor, resulting in power increase by twice every 6.5 years. It is considered that the power dissipation of {CMOS} chips will steadily be increased as a natural result of device scaling. Technology scaling will become difficult due to the power wall. On the other hand, future computer and communications technology will require further reduction in power dissipation. Since no new energy efficient device technology is on the horizon, low power {CMOS} design should be challenged. This paper discusses what and how much designers can do for {CMOS} power reduction.},

In the present approach, the numbers of reaction firings are correlated binomial distributions and the sampling procedure is independent of any permutation of the reaction channels. This enables the algorithm to efficiently handle large systems with disparate rates, providing substantial computational savings in certain cases. Several mechanisms for controlling the accuracy and the appearance of negative species are described. The advantages and drawbacks of R -leaping are assessed by simulations on a number of benchmark problems and the results are discussed in comparison with established methods.},

Allowing for the finite lifetime of the catalyst (B→inert products) adds another dimension. The dependence of the stationary-states on residence-time now yields isolas or mushrooms. Sustained oscillations (stable limit cycles) are also possible. The onset of oscillation corresponds to a change in the character of the stationary-state (from stable focus to unstable focus) and the conditions for this change can be evaluated analytically. The period of the oscillations and their amplitudes increase as the residence time is lengthened. A total of nine different phase-portraits in the a–b plane has been found.

The isothermal system is less complex than the exothermic, first-order reaction in a {CSTR}, but there are strong analogies between the two.},

Moreover, the number of membrane molecules can be small and stochastic effects can become relevant. Pathways usually consist of a complex interaction network and are characterized by a large set of parameters. The inclusion of spatial and stochastic effects is a major challenge in developing quantitative and dynamic models of pathways.
Results: We have developed a particle-based spatial stochastic method ({GMP}) to simulate biochemical networks in space, including fluctuations from the diffusion of particles and reactions. Gradients emerging from membrane reactions can be resolved. As case studies for the {GMP} method we used a simple gene expression system and the phosphoenolpyruvate:glucose phosphotransferase system pathway.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.0027},
	abstract = {Motivation: The Stochastic Simulation Algorithm ({SSA}) has largely diffused in the field of systems biology. This approach needs many realizations for establishing statistical results on the system under study. It is very computationnally demanding, and with the advent of large models this burden is increasing. Hence parallel implementation of {SSA} are needed to address these needs. At the very heart of the {SSA} is the selection of the next reaction to occur at each time step, and to the best of our knowledge all implementations are based on an inverse transformation method. However, this method involves a random number of steps to select this next reaction and is poorly amenable to a parallel implementation. Results: Here, we introduce a parallel acceptance-rejection algorithm to select the K next reactions to occur. This algorithm uses a deterministic number of steps, a property well suited to a parallel implementation. It is simple and small, accurate and scalable. We propose a Graphics Processing Unit ({GPU}) implementation and validate our algorithm with simulated propensity distributions and the propensity distribution of a large model of yeast iron metabolism. We show that our algorithm can handle thousands of selections of next reaction to occur in parallel on the {GPU}, paving the way to massive {SSA}. Availability: We present our {GPU}-{AR} algorithm that focuses on the very heart of the {SSA}. We do not embed our algorithm within a full implementation in order to stay pedagogical and allows its rapid implementation in existing software. We hope that it will enable stochastic modelers to implement our algorithm with the benefits of their own optimizations.},

	abstract = {Multisite covalent modification of proteins is omnipresent in eukaryotic cells. A well-known example is the mitogen-activated protein kinase ({MAPK}) cascade where, in each layer of the cascade, a protein is phosphorylated at two sites. It has long been known that the response of a {MAPK} pathway strongly depends on whether the enzymes that modify the protein act processively or distributively. A distributive mechanism, in which the enzyme molecules have to release the substrate molecules in between the modification of the two sites, can generate an ultrasensitive response and lead to hysteresis and bistability. We study by Green’s Function Reaction Dynamics ({GFRD}), a stochastic scheme that makes it possible to simulate biochemical networks at the particle level in time and space, a dual phosphorylation cycle in which the enzymes act according to a distributive mechanism. We find that the response of this network can differ dramatically from that predicted by a mean-field analysis based on the chemical rate equations. In particular, rapid rebindings of the enzyme molecules to the substrate molecules after modification of the first site can markedly speed up the response and lead to loss of ultrasensitivity and bistability. In essence, rapid enzyme-substrate rebindings can turn a distributive mechanism into a processive mechanism. We argue that slow {ADP} release by the enzymes can protect the system against these rapid rebindings, thus enabling ultrasensitivity and bistability.},

Here we present a novel variant of the exact {GSSA} that is amenable to acceleration by using graphics processing units ({GPUs}). We parallelize the execution of a single realization across threads in a warp (fine-grained parallelism). A warp is a collection of threads that are executed synchronously on a single multi-processor. Warps executing in parallel on different multi-processors (coarse-grained parallelism) simultaneously generate multiple trajectories. Novel data-structures and algorithms reduce memory traffic, which is the bottleneck in computing the {GSSA}. Our benchmarks show an 8×−120× performance gain over various state-of-the-art serial algorithms when simulating different types of models.},

Since these simulations are very time consuming, any ideas and strategies aiming at the reduction of {CPU} time are important topics of research. A general and robust idea is the parallelization of source codes/programs. Recently, the technological development of graphics hardware created a possibility to use desktop video cards to solve numerically intensive problems. We present a powerful parallel computing framework for solving reaction–diffusion equations numerically using the Graphics Processing Units ({GPUs}) with {CUDA}. Four different reaction–diffusion problems, (i) diffusion of chemically inert compound, (ii) Turing pattern formation, (iii) phase separation in the wake of a moving diffusion front and (iv) air pollution dispersion were solved, and additionally both the Shared method and the Moving Tiles method were tested. Our results show that parallel implementation achieves typical acceleration values in the order of 5–40 times compared to {CPU} using a single-threaded implementation on a 2.8 {GHz} desktop computer.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in computing have led to an explosion in the amount of data being generated. Processing the ever-growing data in a timely manner has made throughput computing an important aspect for emerging applications. Our analysis of a set of important throughput computing kernels shows that there is an ample amount of parallelism in these kernels which makes them suitable for today's multi-core {CPUs} and {GPUs}. In the past few years there have been many studies claiming {GPUs} deliver substantial speedups (between 10X and 1000X) over multi-core {CPUs} on these kernels. To understand where such large performance difference comes from, we perform a rigorous performance analysis and find that after applying optimizations appropriate for both {CPUs} and {GPUs} the performance gap between an Nvidia {GTX}280 processor and the Intel Core i7-960 processor narrows to only 2.5x on average. In this paper, we discuss optimization techniques for both {CPU} and {GPU}, analyze what architecture features contributed to performance differences between the two architectures, and recommend a set of architectural features which provide significant improvement in architectural efficiency for throughput kernels.},

	abstract = {The stochastic time evolution method has been used previously to study non-linear chemical reaction processes in well-stirred homogeneous systems. We present the first treatment of diffusion, in the stochastic method, for non-linear reaction–diffusion processes. The derivation introduces mesoscopic rates of diffusion that are formally analogous to reaction rates. We map, using Green's function, the bulk diffusion coefficient D in Fick's differential law to the corresponding transition rate probability for diffusion of a particle between finite volume elements. This generalized stochastic algorithm enables us to numerically calculate the time evolution of a spatially inhomogeneous mixture of reaction–diffusion species in a finite volume. The algorithm is equivalent to solving the time evolution of the spatially inhomogeneous master equation. A unique feature of our method is that the time step is stochastic and is generated by a probability distribution determined by the intrinsic reaction kinetics and diffusion dynamics. To demonstrate the method, we consider the biologically important nonlinear reaction–diffusion process of calcium wave propagation within living cells.},

The algorithms are validated by solving Fisher’s equation and used to explore the role of the number of particles in pattern formation.

Since the Poisson random variable can have arbitrarily large sample values, there is always the possibility that this procedure will cause one or more reaction channels to fire so many times during τ that the population of some reactant species will be driven negative. Two recent papers have shown how that unacceptable occurrence can be avoided by replacing the Poisson random variables with binomial random variables, whose values are naturally bounded. This paper describes a modified Poisson tau-leaping procedure that also avoids negative populations, but is easier to implement than the binomial procedure. The new Poisson procedure also introduces a second control parameter, whose value essentially dials the procedure from the original Poisson tau-leaping at one extreme to the exact stochastic simulation algorithm at the other; therefore, the modified Poisson procedure will generally be more accurate than the original Poisson procedure.},

Newer {GPU} generations provide a high-level programming interface which turns them into General-Purpose Graphics Processing Units ({GPGPUs}). Our {SSA} exploits {GPGPU} architecture to achieve a performance gain of two orders of magnitude over the fastest existing implementations on conventional hardware.
