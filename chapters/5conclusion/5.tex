What has been done. \\
Both implementations are not perfect. GPUs are reasonable to use. Worth it to learn. Important skill. Learning ot think in parallel is necessary. \\
Results: GPU beets CPU for medium sized problems. Interesting devices. Trend: dynamic parallelism\\
But don't underestimate the potential of CPUS. Future: Xeon Phi \\
Stochastic algorithms are great, examples from several scales (universe, cell, ...). \\
Tau-leaping outperforms classic approaches that consider every individual particle. (more comple implementation) \\
Computational methods are valuable tool, enables understanding dynamic evolution of biological systems, global-level understanding of emergent dynamics... \\
