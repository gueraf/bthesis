In this thesis the deterministic as well as the stochastic approach towards simulating chemical reaction-diffusion systems are presented. Apart from the underlying formalistic concepts two different implementations of the tau-leaping stochastic simulation algorithm are discussed. In addition to theoretical deliberation and accuracy validation, the performance of the algorithm in two parallel computing environments, namely Nvidia CUDA GPGPUs and OpenMP-enabled multi-core CPUs, is assessed. Throughout the complete thesis the Gray-Scott model is used as an example to illustrate various results. This reaction-diffusion system is not only subject to pattern-formation, but it is also of great interest due to is computational complexity and practical relevance.
