\chapter{Acknowledgment}
First of all sincere gratitude goes to my supervisor Jana Lipkov\'a. The contribution of her friendly support and helpful suggestions to this thesis cannot be overestimated. 
Furthermore, I would like to express my very great appreciation to Petros Koumoutsakos for giving me the opportunity to write this Bachelor's thesis in his lab. 

I would like to offer my special thanks to my mentors Hans-Joachim Bungartz and Klaus Mainzer at TUM. Their support before and during my semester in Zurich was enormously beneficial. Professor Mainzer's guidance concerning potential topics for this thesis is greatly appreciated. My thanks to Professor Bungartz for being supervisor to this thesis, for his support with administrative matters in Munich and Zurich as well as for his valuable advice on future studies cannot be overemphasized. 

Last but by no means least assistance provided by Gerardo Tauriello, Babak Hejazialhosseini and Christiane Pousa Ribeiro is greatly appreciated. 

The semester at ETH was supported by the European Union's Erasmus Program and by the Max Weber-Programme of the sate of Bavaria. 

This thesis is dedicated to my parents, my sister and my girlfriend.
